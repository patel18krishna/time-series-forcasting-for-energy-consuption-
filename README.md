# Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost

This R script demonstrates a time series forecasting approach using the XGBoost algorithm. The goal is to predict power consumption based on various input features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, general diffuse flows, and diffuse flows.

##Data
Ensure that your data is in CSV format and includes a column named DateTime for the timestamp, and columns for "Temperature", "Humidity", "Wind.Speed", "general.diffuse.flows", "diffuse.flows", and "Zone.1.Power.Consumption".

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following R libraries installed:

```R
install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("xgboost")
```
### FRONTEND CODE
# Power Consumption Analysis

Welcome to the Power Consumption Analysis project! This Graphical User Interface (GUI), built with Python and Tkinter, facilitates the forecasting of power consumption.

## Overview

The GUI empowers users to input key parameters related to power consumption analysis, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, GDF (specifics needed), diffuse flows, and PJME_MW. The interface offers a visual representation for users to conduct power consumption forecasts with ease.
